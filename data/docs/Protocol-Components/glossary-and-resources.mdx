# Glossary and Resources

The Clynto Protocol introduces a range of concepts and terminology that may be new to users or specific to its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This section serves as a comprehensive reference, defining key terms and providing additional resources to deepen your understanding of Clynto. Whether you’re an investor analyzing the platform, a collaborator integrating with it, or a community member exploring its features, this glossary and resource list will support your engagement with Clynto’s documentation and community.

## 1. Introduction to Glossary and Resources

Understanding Clynto’s terminology is essential for navigating its lending, borrowing, governance, and rewards systems. This glossary compiles definitions from across the documentation, ensuring clarity for all users. Additionally, the resources section links to external documentation and community channels, offering pathways to further explore blockchain technology, Clynto’s supported networks, and ways to connect with its ecosystem. This reference is a tool to empower you, whether you’re onboarding, investing, or contributing to Clynto’s growth.

## 2. Glossary

Below is an alphabetical list of key terms used in the Clynto Protocol, with concise definitions:

- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: The yearly interest rate applied to loans, expressed as a percentage. In Clynto, APRs are set by governance for different LTV tiers (e.g., 70% for mid-risk loans).
- **CLY Token**: The native cryptocurrency of Clynto, used for governance voting (1 token = 1 vote), staking (to reduce fees), and as collateral in lending pools.
- **Collateral**: Assets (crypto or NFTs) deposited by borrowers to secure a loan, locked until repayment or liquidation. Value is assessed in real-time via oracles.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: A financial system built on blockchain technology, operating without intermediaries, enabling trustless lending, borrowing, and governance.
- **Early Liquidation Notice**: A lender-initiated process to liquidate collateral before the LTV reaches the liquidation point (e.g., 90%), with a notice period (e.g., 7 days) during which interest accrual pauses.
- **Instant Liquidation**: Immediate collateral liquidation triggered when LTV hits the governance-set threshold (e.g., 90%) or the loan term expires, ensuring lender protection.
- **JWT Token**: A JSON Web Token used for off-chain wallet authentication when lenders submit investment offers, enhancing efficiency before on-chain deployment.
- **Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)**: A token sale mechanism on Fjord Foundry for CLY launch (April 2025), starting at $1.50 and decreasing to $0.75 over 48 hours for fair distribution.
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**: The ratio of a loan amount to its collateral value, calculated as (Total Loan Amount / Collateral Value) * 100, used to assess risk and assign APR tiers.
- **Nectar Points**: Non-transferable rewards earned off-chain for activities (e.g., 20 points per vote), claimable on-chain and redeemable for fee reductions (1,000 points = 1% off).
- **Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**: A unique digital asset on the blockchain (e.g., ERC-721), usable as collateral in Clynto, representing ownership of specific items or content.
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with terms coded on the blockchain, automating Clynto’s loan agreements, collateral management, and governance processes.
- **Staking**: Locking CLY tokens in the protocol to unlock governance rights and fee discounts (e.g., 0% fees for stakers), earning Nectar points (20 per 1,000 CLY).

- **Deep Dive**: Explore linked resources for technical details (e.g., Solana docs for multi-chain understanding).
- **Stay Connected**: Leverage community channels to ask questions or contribute ideas, enhancing your Clynto experience.

## 5. Example Applications

- **APR in Action**: A 70% APR on a $1,000 loan means $700 annual interest, accrued daily as $1.92 (70 / 365 * 1000).
- **LTV Shift**: A $5,000 loan with $10,000 collateral (50% LTV) becomes 55.56% if collateral drops to $9,000 (5000 / 9000 * 100).
- **Staking Benefit**: Staking 2,000 CLY reduces a 1% loan fee to 0%, saving $10 on a $1,000 loan.
